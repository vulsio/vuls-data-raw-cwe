Weaknesses and categories in this view are focused on issues that affect ICS (Industrial Control Systems) but have not been traditionally covered by CWE in the past due to its earlier emphasis on enterprise IT software. Note: weaknesses in this view are based on \"Nearest IT Neighbor\" recommendations and other suggestions by the CWE team. These relationships are likely to change in future CWE versions.",
