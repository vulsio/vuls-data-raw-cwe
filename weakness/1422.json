	"extended_description": "\n\t\t\t<xhtml:p>Software may use a variety of techniques to preserve the\n\t\t\tconfidentiality of private data that is accessible within the current\n\t\t\tprocessor context. For example, the memory safety and type safety\n\t\t\tproperties of some high-level programming languages help to prevent\n\t\t\tsoftware written in those languages from exposing private data. As a\n\t\t\tsecond example, software sandboxes may co-locate multiple users'\n\t\t\tsoftware within a single process. The processor's Instruction Set\n\t\t\tArchitecture (ISA) may permit one user's software to access another\n\t\t\tuser's data (because the software shares the same address space), but\n\t\t\tthe sandbox prevents these accesses by using software techniques such\n\t\t\tas bounds checking.</xhtml:p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<xhtml:p>If incorrect or stale data can be forwarded (for example, from a\n\t\t\tcache) to transient operations, then the operations'\n\t\t\tmicroarchitectural side effects may correspond to the data. If an\n\t\t\tattacker can trigger these transient operations and observe their side\n\t\t\teffects through a covert channel, then the attacker may be able to\n\t\t\tinfer the data. For example, an attacker process may induce transient\n\t\t\texecution in a victim process that causes the victim to inadvertently\n\t\t\taccess and then expose its private data via a covert channel. In the\n\t\t\tsoftware sandbox example, an attacker sandbox may induce transient\n\t\t\texecution in its own code, allowing it to transiently access and\n\t\t\texpose data in a victim sandbox that shares the same address space.</xhtml:p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<xhtml:p>Consequently, weaknesses that arise from incorrect/stale data\n\t\t\tforwarding might violate users' expectations of software-based memory\n\t\t\tsafety and isolation techniques. If the data forwarding behavior is\n\t\t\tnot properly documented by the hardware vendor, this might violate the\n\t\t\tsoftware vendor's expectation of how the hardware should behave.</xhtml:p>\n\t\t  ",
