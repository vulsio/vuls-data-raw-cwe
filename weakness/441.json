The SoC implements\n                     access control to protect the registers in the IP core\n                     (which registers store the design-house secrets) from\n                     malicious, ring-3 (least trusted ring) code executing on\n                     the microcontroller.  The DMA controller, however, is not\n                     blocked off from accessing the IP core for functional\n                     reasons.\n                 </Intro_Text>\n                 <Example_Code Nature=\"Bad\" Language=\"Other\">\n                     The code in ring-3 (least trusted ring) of the\n                     microcontroller attempts to directly read the protected\n                     registers in IP core through MMIO transactions. However,\n                     this attempt is blocked due to the implemented access\n                     control. Now, the microcontroller configures the DMA core\n                     to transfer data from the protected registers to a memory\n                     region that it has access to. The DMA core, which is\n                     acting as an intermediary in this transaction, does not\n                     preserve the identity of the microcontroller and, instead,\n                     initiates a new transaction with its own identity. Since\n                     the DMA core has access, the transaction (and hence, the\n                     attack) is successful.\n                 </Example_Code>\n                 <Body_Text>The weakness here is that the intermediary or the\n                     proxy agent did not ensure the immutability of the\n                     identity of the microcontroller initiating the\n                     transaction. \n                 </Body_Text>\n                 <Example_Code Nature=\"Good\" Language=\"Other\">The DMA\n                     core forwards this transaction with the identity of the\n                     code executing on the microcontroller, which is the\n                     original initiator of the end-to-end transaction. Now the\n                     transaction is blocked, as a result of forwarding the\n                     identity of the true initiator which lacks the permission\n                     to access the confidential MMIO mapped IP core.\n                 </Example_Code>\n             "
