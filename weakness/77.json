For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute commands of their own choosing, regardless of how those commands are inserted. The command injection could thus be resultant from another weakness. This usage also includes cases in which the functionality allows the user to specify an entire command, which is then executed; within CWE, this situation might be better regarded as an authorization problem (since an attacker should not be able to specify arbitrary commands.)</xhtml:p>\n               <xhtml:p>Another common usage, which includes CWE-77 and its descendants, involves cases in which the attacker injects separators into the command being constructed.</xhtml:p>\n            "
