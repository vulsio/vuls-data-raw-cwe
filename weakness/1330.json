Confidential memory contents can still be readable through data remanence in the hardware.</xhtml:p>\n\t\t\t\t<xhtml:p>Data remanence can occur because of performance optimization or memory organization during 'clear' or 'erase' operations, like a design that allows the memory-organization metadata (e.g., file pointers) to be erased without erasing the actual memory content. To protect against this weakness, memory devices will often support different commands for optimized memory erase and explicit secure erase.</xhtml:p>\n\t\t\t\t<xhtml:p>Data remanence can also happen because of the physical properties of memory circuits in use. For example, static, random-access-memory (SRAM) and dynamic, random-access-memory (DRAM) data retention is based on the charge retained in the memory cell, which depends on factors such as power supply, refresh rates, and temperature.</xhtml:p>\n\t\t\t\t<xhtml:p>Other than explicit erase commands, self-encrypting, secure-memory devices can also support secure erase through cryptographic erase commands. In such designs, only the decryption keys for encrypted data stored on the device are erased. That is, the stored data are always remnant in the media after a cryptographic erase. However, only the encrypted data can be extracted. Thus, protection against data recovery in such designs relies on the strength of the encryption algorithm.</xhtml:p>\n\t\t\t",

On factory reset, user files are erased using explicit, erase commands supported by the flash device.</Body_Text>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Body_Text>In the given, system design, the flash-file system can support performance-optimized erase such that only the file metadata are erased and not the content. If this optimized erase is used for files containing user data during factory-reset flow, then device, flash memory can contain remanent data from these files.</Body_Text>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Body_Text>On device-factory reset, the implementation might not erase these copies, since the file organization has changed and the flash file system does not have the metadata to track all previous copies.</Body_Text>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Body_Text>A flash-memory region that is used by a flash-file system should be fully erased as part of the factory-reset flow.
