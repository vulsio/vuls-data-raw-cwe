Another way to achieve this is through implementation of undocumented features. An attacker might exploit these interfaces for unauthorized access.</xhtml:p>\n            ",

The undocumented, special-access features are identified, and attackers can activate them by sending specific commands via UART before secure-boot phase completes. Using these hidden features, attackers can perform reads and writes to memory via the UART interface. At runtime, the attackers can also execute arbitrary code and dump the entire memory contents.</xhtml:div>\n                    </Example_Code>\n                    <Body_Text>Remove all chicken bits and hidden features that are exposed to attackers.
