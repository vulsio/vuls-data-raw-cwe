This allows the end point to be used with devices that function as a controller or responder. If this bit is set by default in hardware, or if firmware incorrectly sets it later, a device intended to be a responder on a fabric is now capable of controlling transactions to other devices and might compromise system security.</xhtml:p>\n\t\t\t",

The main CPU is the only component that can control transactions, and all the other components are responder-only devices. All the components implement a PCIe end-point to interface with the rest of the platform. The responder devices should have the bus-control-enable bit in the PCIe-end-point register set to 0 in hardware to prevent the devices from controlling transactions to the CPU or other peripherals.</Intro_Text>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Body_Text>The audio-codec chip does not have the bus-controller-enable-register bit hardcoded to 0.  There is no platform-firmware flow to verify that the bus-controller-enable bit is set to 0 in all responders.</Body_Text>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Body_Text>Audio codec can now master transactions to the CPU and other platform components. Potentially, it can modify assets in other platform components to subvert system security. </Body_Text>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Body_Text>Platform firmware includes a flow to check the configuration of bus-controller-enable bit in all responder devices. If this register bit is set on any of the responders, platform firmware sets it to 0. Ideally, the default value of this register bit should be hardcoded to 0 in RTL. It should also have access control to prevent untrusted entities from setting this bit to become bus controllers.</Body_Text>\n\t\t\t\t"
