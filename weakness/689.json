The larger the archive, the larger the timing window for the race condition.</xhtml:p>\n                  <xhtml:p>This weakness has also occurred in some operating system utilities that perform copies of deeply nested directories containing a large number of files.</xhtml:p>\n                  <xhtml:p>This weakness can occur in any type of functionality that involves copying objects or resources in a multi-user environment, including at the application level. For example, a document management system might allow a user to copy a private document, but if it does not set the new copy to be private as soon as the copy begins, then other users might be able to view the document while the copy is still taking place.</xhtml:p>\n               "
