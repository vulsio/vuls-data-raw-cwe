  "extended_description": "\n\t\t\t\t<xhtml:p>In a System-On-Chip (SoC), various integrated circuits and hardware engines generate transactions such as to access (reads/writes) assets or perform certain actions (e.g., reset, fetch, compute, etc.). Among various types of message information, a typical transaction is comprised of source identity (to identify the originator of the transaction) and a destination identity (to route the transaction to the respective entity). Sometimes the transactions are qualified with a security identifier. This security identifier helps the destination agent decide on the set of allowed actions (e.g., access an asset for read and writes).</xhtml:p>\n\t\t\t\t<xhtml:p>A typical bus connects several leader and follower agents. Some follower agents implement bus protocols differently from leader agents. A protocol conversion happens at a bridge to seamlessly connect different protocols on the bus. One example is a system that implements a leader with the Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) protocol and a follower with the Open-Core Protocol (OCP). A bridge AHB-to-OCP is needed to translate the transaction from one form to the other.</xhtml:p>\n\t\t\t\t<xhtml:p>A common weakness that can exist in this scenario is that this conversion between protocols is implemented incorrectly, whereupon an untrusted agent may gain unauthorized access to an asset.</xhtml:p>\n\t\t\t",

Let us assume we have a follower agent that only understands OCP. To connect this follower to the leader, a bridge is introduced, i.e., AHB to OCP.\n                        </xhtml:p>\n                        <xhtml:p>\n                            The follower has assets to protect accesses from untrusted leaders, and it employs access controls based on policy, (e.g., AES-Key registers for encryption or decryption). The key is 128 bits implemented as a set of four 32-bit registers. The key registers are assets, and register AES_KEY_ACCESS_POLICY is defined to provide the necessary access controls. \n                        </xhtml:p>\n                        <xhtml:p>\n                            The AES_KEY_ACCESS_POLICY access-policy register defines which agents with a security identifier in the transaction can access the AES-key registers. The implemented AES_KEY_ACCESS_POLICY has 4 bits where each bit when \"Set\" allows access to the AES-Key registers to the corresponding agent that has the security identifier. The other bits from 31 through 4 are reserved and not used. \n                        </xhtml:p>\n                        <xhtml:table>\n                            <xhtml:tr>\n                                <xhtml:td>\n                                    Register\n                                </xhtml:td>\n                                <xhtml:td>\n                                    Field Description\n                                </xhtml:td>\n                            </xhtml:tr>\n                            <xhtml:tr>\n                                <xhtml:td>\n                                    AES_ENC_DEC_KEY_0\n                                </xhtml:td>\n                                <xhtml:td>\n                                    AES key [0:31] for encryption or decryption Default 0x00000000\n                                </xhtml:td>\n                            </xhtml:tr>\n                            <xhtml:tr>\n                                <xhtml:td>\n                                    AES_ENC_DEC_KEY_1\n                                </xhtml:td>\n                                <xhtml:td>\n                                    AES key [32:63] for encryption or decryption Default 0x00000000\n                                </xhtml:td>\n                            </xhtml:tr>\n                            <xhtml:tr>\n                                <xhtml:td>\n                                    AES_ENC_DEC_KEY_2\n                                </xhtml:td>\n                                <xhtml:td>\n                                    AES key [64:95] for encryption or decryption Default 0x00000000\n                                </xhtml:td>\n                            </xhtml:tr>\n                            <xhtml:tr>\n                                <xhtml:td>\n                                    AES_ENC_DEC_KEY_3\n                                </xhtml:td>\n                                <xhtml:td>\n                                    AES key [96:127] for encryption or decryption Default 0x00000000\n                                </xhtml:td>\n                            </xhtml:tr>\n                            <xhtml:tr>\n                                <xhtml:td>\n                                    AES_KEY_ACCESS_POLICY\n                                </xhtml:td>\n                                <xhtml:td>\n                                    [31:4] Default 0x000000 [3:0] - 0x02 agent with Security Identifier \"1\" has access to AES_ENC_DEC_KEY_0 through AES_ENC_DEC_KEY_4 registers\n                                </xhtml:td>\n                            </xhtml:tr>\n                        </xhtml:table>\n                        <xhtml:p>\n                            During conversion of the AHB-to-OCP transaction, the security identifier information must be preserved and passed on to the follower correctly.\n                        </xhtml:p>\n                    </Intro_Text>\n                    <Example_Code Nature=\"Bad\" Language=\"Other\">\n                        In AHB-to-OCP bridge, the security identifier information conversion is done incorrectly.\n                    </Example_Code>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Body_Text>Because of the incorrect conversion, the security identifier information is either lost or could be modified in such a way that an untrusted leader can access the AES-Key registers.</Body_Text>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Example_Code Nature=\"Good\" Language=\"Other\">The conversion of the signals from one protocol (AHB) to another (OCP) must be done while preserving the security identifier correctly.</Example_Code>\n\t\t\t\t"
