Once detected, it can be difficult to fix, so the administrator may be forced into disabling the product entirely. There are two main variations:</xhtml:p>\n            <xhtml:div style=\"margin-left:1em;\">\n               <xhtml:div>Inbound: the product contains an authentication mechanism that checks for a hard-coded password.</xhtml:div>\n               <xhtml:div>Outbound: the product connects to another system or component, and it contains hard-coded password for connecting to that component.</xhtml:div>\n            </xhtml:div>\n            <xhtml:p>In the Inbound variant, a default administration account is created, and a simple password is hard-coded into the product and associated with that account. This hard-coded password is the same for each installation of the product, and it usually cannot be changed or disabled by system administrators without manually modifying the program, or otherwise patching the product. If the password is ever discovered or published (a common occurrence on the Internet), then anybody with knowledge of this password can access the product. Finally, since all installations of the product will have the same password, even across different organizations, this enables massive attacks such as worms to take place.</xhtml:p>\n            <xhtml:p>The Outbound variant applies to front-end systems that authenticate with a back-end service. The back-end service may require a fixed password which can be easily discovered. The programmer may simply hard-code those back-end credentials into the front-end product. Any user of that program may be able to extract the password. Client-side systems with hard-coded passwords pose even more of a threat, since the extraction of a password from a binary is usually very simple.</xhtml:p>\n         ",

			"description": "\n                  <xhtml:p>Use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.</xhtml:p>\n                  <xhtml:p>Attach the monitor to the process and perform a login. Using disassembled code, look at the associated instructions and see if any of them appear to be comparing the input to a fixed string or value.</xhtml:p>\n               "
