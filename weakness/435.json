	"extended_description": "When a system or process combines multiple independent components, this often produces new, emergent behaviors at the system level.  However, if the interactions between these components are not fully accounted for, some of the emergent behaviors can be incorrect or even insecure.",

This distinction can be blurred in real world scenarios, especially when \"de facto\" standards do not comply with specifications, or when there are no standards but there is widespread adoption. As a result, it can be difficult to distinguish these weaknesses during mapping and classification."
