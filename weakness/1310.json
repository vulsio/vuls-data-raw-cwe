The code in ROM is immutable, hence any security vulnerabilities discovered in the ROM code can never be fixed for the systems that are already in use.</xhtml:p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<xhtml:p>A common weakness is that the ROM does not have the ability to patch if security vulnerabilities are uncovered after the system gets shipped.  This leaves the system in a vulnerable state where an adversary can compromise the SoC.</xhtml:p>\n\t\t\t",
