If memory is not cleared after use, the information may be read by less trustworthy parties when the memory is reallocated.</xhtml:p>\n\t\t\t <xhtml:p>This weakness can apply in hardware, such as when a device or system switches between power, sleep, or debug states during normal operation, or when execution changes to different users or privilege levels.</xhtml:p>\n     ",
