When a signal handler uses global or static variables, or invokes functions that ultimately depend on such state or its associated metadata, then it could corrupt system state that is being used by normal functionality. This could subject the program to race conditions or other weaknesses that allow an attacker to cause the program state to be corrupted. While denial of service is frequently the consequence, in some cases this weakness could be leveraged for code execution.</xhtml:p>\n            <xhtml:p>There are several different scenarios that introduce this issue:</xhtml:p>\n               <xhtml:ul>\n                  <xhtml:li>Invocation of non-reentrant functions from within the handler. One example is malloc(), which modifies internal global variables as it manages memory. Very few functions are actually reentrant.</xhtml:li>\n                  <xhtml:li>Code sequences (not necessarily function calls) contain non-atomic use of global variables, or associated metadata or structures, that can be accessed by other functionality of the program, including other signal handlers. Frequently, the same function is registered to handle multiple signals.</xhtml:li>\n                  <xhtml:li>The signal handler function is intended to run at most one time, but instead it can be invoked multiple times. This could happen by repeated delivery of the same signal, or by delivery of different signals that have the same handler function (CWE-831).</xhtml:li>\n               </xhtml:ul>\n            <xhtml:p>Note that in some environments or contexts, it might be possible for the signal handler to be interrupted itself.</xhtml:p>\n            <xhtml:p>If both a signal handler and the normal behavior of the product have to operate on the same set of state variables, and a signal is received in the middle of the normal execution's modifications of those variables, the variables may be in an incorrect or corrupt state during signal handler execution, and possibly still incorrect or corrupt upon return.</xhtml:p>\n         ",
