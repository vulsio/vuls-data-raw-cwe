The keys for these operations or the intermediate values are stored in registers internal to the cryptographic core. These internal registers are in the Memory Mapped Input Output (MMIO) space and are blocked from access by software and other untrusted agents on the SoC. These registers are accessible through the debug and test interface.</Intro_Text>\n\n                <Example_Code Nature=\"Bad\" Language=\"Other\">In the above scenario, registers that store keys and intermediate values of cryptographic operations are not cleared when system enters debug mode. An untrusted actor running a debugger may read the contents of these registers and gain access to secret keys and other sensitive cryptographic information.</Example_Code>\n\n                <Example_Code Nature=\"Good\" Language=\"Other\">Whenever the chip enters debug mode, all registers containing security-sensitive data are be cleared rendering them unreadable.</Example_Code>\n            "
