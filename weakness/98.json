Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.</xhtml:p>\n                  <xhtml:p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"</xhtml:p>\n                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.</xhtml:p>\n                  <xhtml:p>When validating filenames, use stringent lists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single \".\" character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as \"/\" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.</xhtml:p>\n                  <xhtml:p>Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters.

Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if \"../\" sequences are removed from the \".../...//\" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of \"../\" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the \"../\" string.</xhtml:p>\n               "
