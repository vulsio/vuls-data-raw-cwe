For example, Javascript-based web widgets may be inserted by using '&lt;SCRIPT SRC=\"http://other.domain.here\"&gt;' tags, which causes the code to run in the domain of the product, not the remote site from which the widget was loaded. As a result, the included code has access to the local DOM, including cookies and other data that the developer might not want the remote site to be able to access.</xhtml:p>\n            <xhtml:p>Such dependencies may be desirable, or even required, but sometimes programmers are not aware that a dependency exists.</xhtml:p>\n         ",
