A larger attack surface provides more places to attack, and more opportunities for developers to introduce weaknesses.  In some cases, this measure may reflect other aspects of quality besides security; e.g., a product with many inputs and outputs may require a large number of tests in order to improve code coverage.</xhtml:p>",
