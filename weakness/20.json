	"extended_description": "\n\t   <xhtml:p>Input validation is a frequently-used technique\n\t   for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to\n\t   ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the\n\t   code, or when communicating with other components.  When\n\t   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is\n\t   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by\n\t   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the\n\t   system receiving unintended input, which may result in\n\t   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or\n\t   arbitrary code execution.</xhtml:p>\n\t   <xhtml:p>Input validation is not the only technique for\n\t   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to\n\t   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such\n\t   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous\n\t   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to\n\t   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included\n\t   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well\n\t   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)</xhtml:p>\n\t   <xhtml:p>Input validation can be applied to:</xhtml:p>\n\t   <xhtml:ul>\n\t     <xhtml:li>raw data - strings, numbers, parameters, file contents, etc.</xhtml:li>\n\t     <xhtml:li>metadata - information about the raw data, such as headers or size</xhtml:li>\n\t   </xhtml:ul>\n\t   <xhtml:p>Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data\n\t   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of\n\t   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or\n\t   structured data.</xhtml:p>\n\t   <xhtml:p>Many properties of raw data or metadata may need\n\t   to be validated upon entry into the code, such\n\t   as:</xhtml:p>\n\t   <xhtml:ul>\n\t     <xhtml:li>specified quantities such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, etc.</xhtml:li>\n\t     <xhtml:li>implied or derived quantities, such as the actual size of a file instead of a specified size</xhtml:li>\n\t     <xhtml:li>indexes, offsets, or positions into more complex data structures</xhtml:li>\n\t     <xhtml:li>symbolic keys or other elements into hash tables, associative arrays, etc.</xhtml:li>\n\t     <xhtml:li>well-formedness, i.e. syntactic correctness - compliance with expected syntax </xhtml:li>\n\t     <xhtml:li>lexical token correctness - compliance with rules for what is treated as a token</xhtml:li>\n\t     <xhtml:li>specified or derived type - the actual type of the input (or what the input appears to be)</xhtml:li>\n\t     <xhtml:li>consistency - between individual data elements, between raw data and metadata, between references, etc.</xhtml:li>\n\t     <xhtml:li>conformance to domain-specific rules, e.g. business logic </xhtml:li>\n\t     <xhtml:li>equivalence - ensuring that equivalent inputs are treated the same</xhtml:li>\n\t     <xhtml:li>authenticity, ownership, or other attestations about the input, e.g. a cryptographic signature to prove the source of the data</xhtml:li>\n\t   </xhtml:ul>\n\t   <xhtml:p>Implied or derived properties of data must often\n\t   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in\n\t   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor\n\t   to improper input validation.\n\t   </xhtml:p>\n\t   <xhtml:p>Note that \"input validation\" has very different\n\t   meanings to different people, or within different\n\t   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when\n\t   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,\n\t   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control\n\t   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able\n\t   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred\n\t   to as input validation.</xhtml:p>\n\t   <xhtml:p>Finally, it is important to emphasize that the\n\t   distinctions between input validation and output escaping\n\t   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to\n\t   understand the difference, including how input validation\n\t   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,\n\t   especially when less stringent data types must be\n\t   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection\n\t   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a\n\t   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation\n\t   step since it is a common last name in the English\n\t   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly\n\t   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"\n\t   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or\n\t   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the\n\t   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it\n\t   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name\n\t   would be recorded.</xhtml:p>\n       ",

			"description": "Fuzzing techniques can be useful for detecting input validation errors. When unexpected inputs are provided to the software, the software should not crash or otherwise become unstable, and it should generate application-controlled error messages. If exceptions or interpreter-generated error messages occur, this indicates that the input was not detected and handled within the application logic itself."
