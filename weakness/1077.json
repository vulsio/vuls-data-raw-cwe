	"extended_description": "\n\t   <xhtml:p>Numeric calculation using floating point values\n\t   can generate imprecise results because of rounding errors.\n\t   As a result, two different calculations might generate\n\t   numbers that are mathematically equal, but have slightly\n\t   different bit representations that do not translate to the\n\t   same mathematically-equal values.  As a result, an equality\n\t   test or other comparison might produce unexpected\n\t   results.</xhtml:p>\n\t   <xhtml:p>This issue can prevent the product from running reliably.  If the relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability problem might introduce a vulnerability.</xhtml:p>",
