			"text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t<Intro_Text>A memory-controller IP block is connected to the on-chip fabric in a System on Chip (SoC).  The memory controller is configured to divide the memory into four parts: one original and three mirrored regions inside the memory. The upper two bits of the address indicate which region is being addressed. 00 indicates the original region and 01, 10, and 11 are used to address the mirrored regions. All four regions operate in a lock-step manner and are always synchronized. The firewall in the on-chip fabric is programmed to protect the assets in the memory.</Intro_Text>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Body_Text>The firewall only protects the original range but not the mirrored regions.</Body_Text>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Body_Text>The attacker (as an unprivileged user) sends a write transaction to the mirrored region. The mirrored region has an address with the upper two bits set to \"10\" and the remaining bits of the address pointing to an asset. The firewall does not block this write transaction. Once the write is successful, contents in the protected-memory region are also updated. Thus, the attacker can bypass existing, memory protections.</Body_Text>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Body_Text>Firewall should protect mirrored regions.</Body_Text>\n\t\t\t\t"
