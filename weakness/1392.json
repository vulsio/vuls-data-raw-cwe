If exploited, these vulnerabilities often allowed adversaries to change how the products operated, ranging from denial of service to changing the code that the products executed. Since these products were often used in industries such as power, electrical, water, and others, there could even be safety implications.</Intro_Text>\n          <Body_Text>At least one OT product used default credentials.</Body_Text>\n        "
