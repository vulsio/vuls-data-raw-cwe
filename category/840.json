  "summary": "Weaknesses in this category identify some of the underlying problems that commonly allow attackers to manipulate the business logic of an application. Errors in business logic can be devastating to an entire application. They can be difficult to find automatically, since they typically involve legitimate use of the application's functionality. However, many business logic errors can exhibit patterns that are similar to well-understood implementation and design weaknesses.",

Such issues might not be easily detectable via automatic code analysis, because the associated operations do not produce clear errors or undefined behavior at the code level. However, many such \"business logic\" issues can be understood as instances of other weaknesses such as input validation, access control, numeric computation, order of operations, etc.</xhtml:p>\n\t    "

There is debate within the community about whether these problems represent particularly new concepts, or if they are variations of well-known principles.</xhtml:p>\n               <xhtml:p>Many business logic flaws appear to be oriented toward business processes, application flows, and sequences of behaviors, which are not as well-represented in CWE as weaknesses related to input validation, memory management, etc.</xhtml:p>\n            "
